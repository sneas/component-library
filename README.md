## Motivation

Most web projects consist of components. They could be simple basic components like texts, icons, buttons, and form inputs. Or complex components like video player, sophisticated inputs (i.e., typeahead), menus, popovers, etc. Any large project reaches a point when it's hard to remember and control all the pages and their components.

A component library is a special place to store and manage all the HTML components of a website in one place.

Features:
* easy to install
* easy to manage
* easy to integrate with existing project
* absence of conflicts with existing JS and CSS

## Installation

```bash
npm install component-library
```

## Integration with project

### List of components

Create an empty folder in your projects's file system and fill it with HTML files (components). One HTML file per one component.

See [demo/src/templates](demo/src/templates) as an example.

### Integration with build process

As a reference I've used Gulp but it's easy to add components library into any build system. All you need is to require component library, point it to your newly created components folder and give it links to your projects's CSS and JS files.

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp'),
    componentLibrary = require('component-library');

gulp.task('cl', function(cb) {
    componentLibrary(
        '/project/templates/dir',
        '/project/public/component-library',
        {
            baseUrl: '/component-library/',
            favicon: {
                href: '/project/favicon.ico',
                rel: 'shortcut icon',
                type: 'image/x-icon'
            },
            js: [
                //List of your project's JS files goes here
                '/project/js/file.js'
            ],
            css: [
                //List of your project's CSS files goes here
                '/project/css/file.css'
            ]
        }
    ).then(function() {
        cb();
    }).catch(function(er) {
        cb(er);
    });
});

gulp.task('cl:watch', ['cl'], function() {
    gulp.watch(['/project/templates/dir'], ['cl']);
});
```

## FAQ
### What if my project has a custom initialization logic in layout?
Create you own layout file by copying minimum HTML required:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    {{ content }}
</body>
</html>
```

Add your custom code to it. **NB:** You can add only the required code. All the CSS links and JS scripts will be added automatically.
Add the `layout` param to the configuration object. Example:
```javascript
var componentLibrary = require('component-library');

componentLibrary(
    '/project/component-library/templates/dir',
    '/project/public/component-library',
    {
        layout: '/project/component-library/your-layout.html',
        baseUrl: '/component-library/',
        favicon: {
            href: '/project/favicon.ico',
            rel: 'shortcut icon',
            type: 'image/x-icon'
        },
        js: [
            //List of your project's JS files goes here
            '/project/js/file.js'
        ],
        css: [
            //List of your project's CSS files goes here
            '/project/css/file.css'
        ]
    }
);
```

See [demo/src/layout.html](demo/src/layout.html) as an example.
